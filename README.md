# Ambient Soundbits

This module allows GM users to create "soundbits." These are ambient sounds on the canvas that have a radius of 0, but can be activated (via right click or P hotkey) to play the associated sound to all users.

The module also adds a toggle to allow ambient sounds to be visible on all layers.

Each ambient sound is labeled with the sound's filename to make it easier to preview the sound.

Soundbits can be created by using the Create Soundbits tool on the sound control bar or by holding the Shift-key when drag&dropping a sound from a playlist onto the canvas.
